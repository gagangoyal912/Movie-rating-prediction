# Movie Rating Prediction with Python

## Overview
The Movie Rating Prediction project aims to build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, actors, and other relevant factors. By analyzing historical movie data, this project seeks to understand the factors influencing movie ratings and develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate these ratings.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about movies, including:

- **Title**: The title of the movie.
- **Genre**: The genre(s) of the movie.
- **Director**: The director(s) of the movie.
- **Actors**: The main actors in the movie.
- **Release Year**: The year the movie was released.
- **Runtime**: The duration of the movie.
- **Budget**: The budget allocated for the movie.
- **Box Office**: The revenue generated by the movie.
- **Rating**: The rating given to the movie (target variable).



## Key Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., genre, director, actors).
- Normalizing and scaling features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzing the distribution of movie ratings.
- Exploring relationships between features and ratings.
- Visualizing data using plots.

### 3. Feature Engineering:
- Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., number of genres, actor popularity).
- Selecting relevant features based on correlation and importance.

### 4. Model Building:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
- Fine-tuning models using hyperparameter optimization.

### 5. Model Evaluation:
- Comparing different models.
- Selecting the best model based on performance metrics.
- Making predictions on the test dataset.


## Results
The final model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict movie ratings. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the notebooks.
